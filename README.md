# Raid-Toolbox

A big toolkit of spamming tools for discord.

Supports Windows, Linux and [Android](https://github.com/DeadBread76/Raid-Toolbox/wiki/How-to-set-up-Termux-to-run-RTB)(Partialy). (Tested on Windows 10 Education/Professional, Ubuntu 18.10)

(Linux has issues with the Voice Chat Spammer, It locks the menu up and you are unable to do anything. I am trying to find a fix.)
